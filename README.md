## Introduction
Being mainly a project for myself, my intention is to collect coding challenges throughout time and solve them in as many programming languages as possible. Somehow rekindle the original problem-solving passion all programmers first get ignited by.

This repository houses solutions to various coding challenges across different domains of computer science. Whether you're a newbie looking to practice or a seasoned developer wanting to polish their skills, there's (or will be) something for everyone!

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/emdeevy/challenges.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the challenge of your interest.
3. Each challenge will have a detailed problem statement and a solution.
4. Feel free to run the solution and test against your own inputs.

## Contribution Guidelines
Obviously, I welcome contributors! If you have a challenge not listed here or a different solution, please consider adding. Here's how:
1. Fork this repository.
2. Add your challenge or both the challenge and solution in the appropriate directories.
3. Make sure to include a detailed problem statement.
4. Raise a pull request.
